[center]Updated June 2nd, 2017[/center]

[color=orange][size=18pt]Description:[/size][/color]
This mod allows you to create components at a Smithy out of any metal. The process is expensive but invaluable for certain playthroughs.
For the sake of sanity the vanilla Component Workbench recipe has been sped up to give some incentive to still use it.

Savegame safe.
