[color=orange][size=18pt]Description:[/size][/color]
At it's most basic level this mod sets most things to be constructed by stuff rather than a static cost. This translates into being able to make lamps and smithies and solar panels and all kinds of other things out of any metal you like (currently works with Cupro's Alloys for additional metal types). Also allows furniture to be made of any type of wood or similar material where appropriate (this mod adds new types of wood that you can get from the vanilla trees).

Includes a new drilling rig that allows you to mine up small amounts of metals, not intended as a primary source of metal but a good option for playing on flat maps after you've exhausted all of your mineral supplies.

Lowers the power requirement for Electric Lamps to 20w per lamp.

Includes new carpet colors with burned variant for the new burned floors.

Current compatibility for [url=https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=32190.0]Cupro's Alloys[/url], [url=https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=32190.0]Cupro's Stones[/url] and will add new matching wood types to [url=https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=12934.0]Vegetable Garden[/url] trees very soon.
